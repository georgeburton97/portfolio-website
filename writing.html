	<h2>Writing</h2>
	
	<span class="generalspan">
		<p>Writing is a lot of fun. I can write for online, print, and copy/clips for presenters. I also have experience in managing and writing posts for social media platforms.

			Whether it be a news article, an email campaign, or a product page, I will be able to plan and execute original content ideas, all while delivering the right look and feel of the brand.
			
			My demonstrated ability to edit and proofread while working in a 24/7 newsroom environment ensures that all of my work is up to a high standard.</p>
